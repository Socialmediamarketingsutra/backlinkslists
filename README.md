Backlinks, often referred to as inbound or incoming links, are links from one website to a page on another website. They play a crucial role in search engine optimisation (SEO) as they signal to search engines that the content on your website is valuable and trustworthy. When a site links to another, itâ€™s like a vote of confidence in your content. The more quality backlinks a site has, the higher it's likely to rank in search engine results.
